<h3>Hi! I'm Peter.</h3>
<p>
I'm an artist and an academic. 
<br><br>
I've illustrated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZNuXh2Mu7X/">magazine covers</a>, 
written an academic article
(forthcoming Sep. 2022),
and made some little <a href="https://holymahogany.itch.io/">videogames</a>.
<br><br>
Currently, I'm a PhD candidate
in art history at Ohio State.
I study comics and painting 
through the lens of modernism.

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>My academic work is guided by an interest in reconsidering the relationship between fine art and popular culture. 
My most recent research project probed the limit to the usefulness of the convention which compares comics to the literary form of the novel.
The result of this project was an article titled "Mixing Comics and Literature in Calvino's <i>Castle of Crossed Destinies</i>." <br><br> Here's that article's abstract:</p>

<p class="block-quote">Italo Calvino’s <i>Castle of Crossed Destinies</i> is unique among his later novels for failing to uphold the rules and constraints that he was increasingly fond of imposing on his works of fiction. To explain the novel’s structural failure, this essay puts aside the framework for analysis which is commonly adopted, a structuralist reading rooted in Saussure's linguistics and Propp's narratology, and suggests a framework stemming from the comics that Calvino would have read in newspapers as a child. An unlikely source of inspiration, these comics actually tell us a great deal about the novel, about its origin, its tone, and its unraveling, as well as help us pinpoint the problem in a clash of interpretative strategies, between one that treats images as changeable and another that treats them as stable points in a narrative continuum.</p>

<h3>Art</h3>

<p>After trying time and again to present my art on my personal website, I finally gave up and moved it to instagram. You can find it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/peterjacobsmyth/">here.</a></p>

<h3>Games</h3>

<p>
  I started making games in undergrad, got away from it for a number of years, and recently came back to it as a way to make art with just my laptop at my kitchen table. To make it even easier to make games, I like to use game-making tools. The best ones are <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">puzzlescript</a> (an engine for creating tile-based puzzle games) and <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> (a more versatile engine with lots of helpful restraints).
