    <p>
      This site is a place to gather<br>
      my various projects.
      <br><br>
      I've illustrated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZNuXh2Mu7X/">magazine covers</a>, <br>
      published an academic article<br>
      (link forthcoming Sep. 2022), <br>
      and created <a href="https://holymahogany.itch.io/">little videogames</a>.
      <br><br>
      As an artist and academic,<br>
      I'm interested in the aesthetics<br>
      of possibility and novelty<br>
      &mdash; sensing the possible<br>
      and the new.
      <br><br>
      Currently, I'm a PhD candidate<br>
      in art history at Ohio State.<br>
      I study comics and painting <br>
      through the lens of modernism.

      What is holy mahogany?<br>
