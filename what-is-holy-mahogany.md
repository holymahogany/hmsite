### Holy Mahogany?
The great modern artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (b. 1895) left his native Hungary as a young man and spent his adult life in places where people had trouble pronouncing his name. As a result he picked up several nicknames. His peers in Germany called him "the constructivist" (because he was thought to be associated with the Russian avant-garde movement "constructivism") and when he came to Chicago he told the Americans that the British called him "holy mahogany" (English homonyms that approximate the original, pronounced "muh-hole-ee nahj"). 

I adopted "holy mahogany" as a moniker for a few reasons. First, I admire Moholy's enduring belief in the social responsibility of art, particularly in the face of war and disruptive political transformations (for him, it was both world wars and the onset of European fascism). Second, I resonate with his distaste for artistic specialization, drawn as I always have been to many different ways of thinking and making. Finally, I like the spiritual connotation of the phrase. I tend to imagine all art as being somehow spiritual, no matter how secular it seems.
