### <i>La civilización del espectáculo</i> (The Civilization of Spectacle, 2012) <br> by Mario Vargas Llosa 

This is a book of essays by Mario Vargas Llosa. Some of these essays were previously published in the Spanish newspaper _El País_. An English translation of the book is available, but it bears an alternate title, _Notes on the Death of Culture_ (2015). This change was likely made to put the book in dialogue with T. S. Eliot’s _Notes Towards the Definition of Culture_ (1949)_._

MVL’s thesis is that Western civilization is becoming a “civilization of spectacle”, by which he means a civilization where the highest value is entertainment, where most people feel it’s their duty to pass the time agreeably, avoiding activities that bore them, give them anxiety, or demand intellectual effort.

The meat of this book is its six main chapters. Interspersed between these are the articles from _El País_, but these tend merely to illustrate the arguments in the main chapters, so I’ll ignore them. I’ll also ignore the introduction (“Metamorphosis of a Word,” a review of works by earlier cultural critics) and conclusion (“Final Reflection”) since they add little of substance.

### Chapter 1: The Civilization of Spectacle (33-59)

This chapter is a disorganized exposition of some of the characteristic phenomena of the civilization of spectacle. The following strike me as the most significant:

· Replacement of traditional arbiters of taste and directors of public opinion (artists, critics, professors, scientists, philosophers, theologians, the figure of the “intellectual”) by celebrities (actors, singers, sports stars).

· Relativism in the arts. There is no longer any consensus as regards aesthetic values. No way to say objectively whether an artist has talent or lacks it, whether a work of art is a lasting contribution or a fleeting fancy.

· Tendency to confuse _value_ with _price_. Related to this is the tendency to treat works of art as commercial products whose success or failure is determined by their performance on the market. (This point seems actually to contradict the book’s thesis, that entertainment is the highest value, suggesting instead that commercial value is highest.)

· Democratization of culture. For MVL, this is born of good intentions but carries negative consequences. A democratic society has a moral obligation to put culture within reach of all its members. But the result is the disappearance of high culture, which is necessarily inaccessible, and the appearance of a superficial mass culture. He expresses the tradeoff that accompanies the democratization of culture with the phrase “quantity at the expense of quality” (35).

· Frivolization of culture. MVL uses “frivolity” to mean an inverted system of values where form matters more than content, appearance more than essence. The frivolity of culture is seen in politics, for instance, in the dominance of publicity over policy, of slogans and tics and postures and scandals over actual political ideas.

### Chapter 2: Brief Discourse on Culture (65-75)

This chapter lays the foundation for the book’s decadence argument. Two things are needed to show that a culture is undergoing a period of decadence (i.e., a period of decline): a before and after, where the before is good and the after bad. The argument here isn’t just that cultural manifestations like works of art are undergoing a period of decadence (i.e., that art is worse now than it was before) but that culture itself is undergoing a period of decadence.

Before, culture had the following characteristics:

· An inherited set of values, on the basis of which a hierarchy was formed, an order of preference or importance, enabling objective distinctions of value to be drawn.

· An elite that preserved and developed this inheritance. The elite’s authority was justified, not by birth, not by political or economic power, but by merit.

· Social cohesion. Ours is a world of specialists, isolated in their fields of expertise. The cultural inheritance served as a common denominator that permitted the specialists to communicate. (To the obvious follow-up question – wasn’t culture specialized? – MVL answers that it actually wasn’t. As a common space or social common denominator, culture was never specialized. The cultured elites were cultural specialists, but the cultural inheritance of which they were the stewards wasn’t specialized. To me this shows that MVL views culture not as something for the great majority to participate in, but rather submit to.)

After, culture had these characteristics instead:

· Equalization of the cultures of different people groups. This was born of the desire to renounce Western ethnocentrism – i.e., the tendency to evaluate non-Western cultures on the basis of Western values. The drawback to this equalization is that we lose the ability to differentiate between positive and negative contributions to culture.

· Breakdown of the limits separating the cultured from the uncultured. This was born of an egalitarian desire to break up that exclusive body of pedants, the cultured elite, who monopolize values, knowledge, and good taste. The drawback to this breakdown of cultural limits is confusion, since there’s no way of knowing what things are, properly speaking, culture, and what things aren’t.

### Chapter 3: Forbidden to Forbid (81-96)

This chapter criticizes some of the theories espoused by postmodernists, in particular Foucault’s theory that social institutions – the school, the church, sexuality, language, justice, psychiatry – are power structures erected to repress and domesticate the social body. This theory, together with iconoclastic student movements like the May ’68 protests, gives legitimacy and glamour to the idea that authority is suspicious and that it is noble to resist and destroy it. The consequence of this generalized disregard for authority is not, however, liberation of creative impulses, but chaos. As evidence of this chaos, MVL cites incidents of student-perpetrated violence in French schools. (It seems that American school shootings aren't on his radar. American culture isn't absent from the book, but it is de-centered. His examples are drawn mainly from Spanish, French, British, and South American cultures.)

Also criticized in this chapter is Derrida’s theory that language doesn’t express reality, but rather itself. If this is true, then literature is gratuitous and solipsistic. If it can’t reflect the world, then neither can it effect the world. It can’t penetrate to the depths of the human experience, nor can it hope to meaningfully change or model it. In other words, language loses its social responsibility.

### Chapter 4: The Disappearance of Eroticism (105-116)

This chapter argues that sexual liberation, for all the good it has done (more rights for women, less prejudice against non-normative sexual orientations, etc.), has had the unfortunate consequence of trivializing sex, removing the forms that civilize it, reducing it to an animal instinct. Emblematic of this fact is the disappearance of eroticism, defined as the transformation of a physical impulse into a creative endeavor, sublimating sexual pleasure in a work of art.

### Chapter 5: Culture, Politics, and Power (129-151)

This chapter argues that in the civilization of spectacle, culture corrupts politics. The civic duty of the citizen to participate in politics is discredited because the mass media, in its eagerness to fulfill the demand for spectacle and entertainment, exaggerates the negative in politics and makes the public doubt the potential for politics to change the world for the better. This situation is not the fault of the owners of the media. They are merely taking advantage of an evil that they didn’t create. The root of the problem is people’s desire for spectacle, and the highest spectacle, the one with which MVL is most concerned, is the intervention of the media into the private lives of celebrities and politicians.

### Chapter 6: The Opium of the People (157-187)

This chapter treats the function of religion in modern culture. It argues that a democratic society is best supported by a culture that’s committed to secularism at the public level and to religious faith at the private level. A democracy needs to be secular at the level of the state because there is no other way to ensure that everyone is free to subscribe to the faith of their choosing, which includes no faith. It relies on religion at the level of the individual because, in most cases, the moral and civic principles that are the foundation of democratic society are drilled into us by religion. MVL argues that for liberal thinkers, economic and political freedoms can only function properly when the social body keeps to a set of values instilled in it by an intense spiritual life.

### Final Essay: Dinosaurs in Difficult Times (213-226)

After the book’s conclusion, MVL inserts a final essay, a lecture titled “Dinosaurs in Difficult Times”, originally delivered at an award ceremony in 1996. This essay consolidates a major through line, namely the idea that culture isn’t just about values and taste, but also about duties and responsibilities. Culture has the potential to turn its subjects into active and responsible members of a free and open democratic society. But in the civilization of spectacle, culture makes us passive and apathetic, which yields control to demagogues and bad actors. Because culture is foundational in MVL’s view and not “superstructural” (i.e., culture isn’t merely the reflection of an economic base), the stakes of the argument are existential. The death of culture entails the death of civilization.
