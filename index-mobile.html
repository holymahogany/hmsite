        Hi! I'm Peter. I'm an artist
        and an academic. This site
        gathers my various projects.
        <br><br>
        I've illustrated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZNuXh2Mu7X/">magazine covers</a>,
        published an academic article
        (link forthcoming Sep. 2022),
        and created <a href="https://holymahogany.itch.io/">little videogames</a>.
        <br><br>
        As an artist and academic,
        I'm interested in the aesthetics
        of possibility and novelty
        &mdash; sensing the possible
        and the new.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I'm a PhD candidate
        in art history at Ohio State.
        I study comics and painting 
        through the lens of modernism.

        What is holy mahogany?
        Well, <a href="/what-is-holy-mahogany">let me explain.</a>
