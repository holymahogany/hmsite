<h3>Hi! I'm Peter.</h3>
I'm an artist and an academic. 
<br><br>
I've illustrated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZNuXh2Mu7X/">magazine covers</a>, 
written an academic article
(forthcoming Sep. 2022),
and made some little <a href="https://holymahogany.itch.io/">videogames</a>.
<br><br>
Currently, I'm a PhD candidate
in art history at Ohio State.
I study comics and painting 
through the lens of modernism.
